Boot Camp Module 6 Challenge

# Description
This is the week 6 Module Challenge for the U of M Coding Bootcamp.

# Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard
The challenge was to build an application that retrieves weather data from a specified API in order to create a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. 

## User Story
```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```
